## about

I am an ai researcher interested in language models.

right now I research and post-train web agents at [yutori](https://yutori.com/). I was the third hire / second ai research hire, and have been working on everything ranging from rl research and data infrastructure to early product prototypes and internal tooling.

I got started with ai research as an ai resident at google, where I researched language model pre-training.
